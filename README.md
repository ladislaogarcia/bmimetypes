Simple class to get the content-type from a file given. Based in its extension.

---
## Requirements

For use it, you will only need Node.js and its global package manager, **npm** ( included in NodeJS ), installed in your environement.

This package is *currently* developed over these following packages versions.

Requirement |   Version
:---        |      ---:
NodeJS      |   14.17.0
npm         |   6.14.13

<br/>

### **NodeJS**
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command. There might be some difference with the version shown by your terminal.
But,it is recommended to install, at least, these ones.

    $ node --version
    v14.17.0

    $ npm --version
    6.14.13

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

<br/>

## Installing

    $ npm install --save bmimetypes
<br/>

## Requiring
Just import in your file as you would do with any other package.

    import { MimeTypes } from 'bmimetypes'
<br/>

## How it works

**bmimetypes** is a node package with a few methods you can use. Developed over two javascript classes called **MimeTypes** and **MagicNumbers** that has all its members 'static'. Both of them.

<br/>

### ***MimeTypes** class*
This class is the package main class. It will give us what we need. The 'Content-Type' of a file. It needs:

1. File over you want to get the 'Content-Type' has to exists.
2. File has to has the right extension correspondig to its content.

There is an exception. If you want to get the 'Content-Type' of a file extension, but we havenÂ´t got any file of that type ( maybe if you are working with **Blob** and not with files ), you can use the method **getMimeTypeFromExtension** that returns the 'Content-Type' of a type of files only passing it the extension we want to know. See section "***methods***" below for more information.

<br/>

It makes in this way:

1. Get the 'Content-Type' over its Magic Numbers.
2. Get the 'Content-Type' over its extension.
3. If there are some kind of issue, this class will throw an error:
    - If the Magic Numbers obtained in steps 1 and 2 above do not match.
    - If the file has an extension that do not correspond to its Magic Numbers.

4. It will returns the 'Content-Type' for the file you have requested or the mime-type by default:

        application/octet-stream

<br/>

This is made over the main method of this class:&nbsp;&nbsp;**getContentType**

<br/>

### ***MimeTypes** class* - **Methods** *(all statics)*
<br/>

**getContentType(** *filename* **)**: It receives a parameter called "filename" which is the name of the file you want to get the 'Content-Type'.
<br/>

**getMimeTypeFromExtension** *fileExtension* **)**: It receives a parameter called "filename" which is the name of the file you want to get the 'Content-Type'.
<br/>

**getMimeTypeFromFileName(** *filename* **)**: An alias of **getContentType**.
